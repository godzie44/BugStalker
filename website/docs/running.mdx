# Running the debugger

## Starting a debugger session

To debug a program from a binary file, use:

```shell
bs my_cool_program
```

To pass arguments to your program:

```shell
bs my_cool_program -- --arg1 val1 --arg2 val2
```

To attach to a running process by its PID:

```shell
bs -p 123
```

## Alternative DAP server

Start the DAP server:

```shell
yadap --listen 127.0.0.1:4711
```

Example `.vscode/launch.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "BugStalker: Launch",
      "type": "bugstalker",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/target/debug/my_app",
      "args": ["--flag", "value"],
      "debugServer": 4711
    },
    {
      "name": "BugStalker: Attach",
      "type": "bugstalker",
      "request": "attach",
      "pid": 12345,
      "terminateDebuggee": false,
      "debugServer": 4711
    }
  ]
}
```

When `terminateDebuggee` is `false`, the debuggee keeps running after the DAP
client disconnects.

## Getting Help

Print `help` to view all available commands.

## Starting and restarting programs

- `run` (alias: `r`) - start or restart the program 

## Controlling program execution

The debugger stops your program when:
- breakpoints are hit
- watchpoints are triggered
- step commands complete
- OS signals are received

BugStalker always stops the entire program, pausing all threads. 
The thread that caused the stop becomes the currently selected thread.

### Continue execution

- `continue` (alias: `c`)- resume execution of a stopped program

## Quit

- `quit` (alias: `q`) - exit BugStalker

## Usage example

Consider this Rust program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("hello world");
}
```

Now you can run, restart, and continue execution (after [breakpoint](/capabilities/control_execution/breakpoint.mdx) are hit) of this program:

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';
import AsciinemaPlayer from '@site/src/components/AsciinemaPlayer';

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <AsciinemaPlayer src="/BugStalker/casts/start.cast" />}
</BrowserOnly>
