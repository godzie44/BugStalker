# Examining shared libraries

- `sharedlib info` - displays a list of shared libraries and their memory mappings

**Note**: memory mappings are unknown until the debugged program starts execution.

## Usage example

Consider this Rust program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("hello world");
}
```

Display information about the loaded shared libraries:

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';
import AsciinemaPlayer from '@site/src/components/AsciinemaPlayer';

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <AsciinemaPlayer src="/BugStalker/casts/sharedlib.cast" />}
</BrowserOnly>
