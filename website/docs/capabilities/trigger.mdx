# Triggers

Write a small program that executes when a debugger event occurs.

## The `trigger` command

The `trigger` command defines a list of commands that execute when a specific event is triggered (e.g., hitting a breakpoint or watchpoint).

Available subcommands:
`trigger any` - defines a list of commands that execute when any breakpoint or watchpoint is hit
`trigger` - defines a list of commands that execute when a previously set breakpoint or watchpoint is hit
`trigger b <number>` - defines a list of commands that execute when the specified breakpoint (by number) is hit
`trigger w <number>` - defines a list of commands that execute when the specified watchpoint (by number) is hit
`trigger info` - displays the list of active triggers

## Usage example

Consider the following Rust program:

```rust
fn print_val(val: u32) {
    println!("val is {val}");
}

fn main() {
    let mut some_val = 3;
    some_val += 1;

    print_val(1337);
}
```

Now, letâ€™s configure the debugger to show a backtrace when a breakpoint or watchpoint is hit:

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';
import AsciinemaPlayer from '@site/src/components/AsciinemaPlayer';

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <AsciinemaPlayer src="/BugStalker/casts/trigger.cast" />}
</BrowserOnly>
