# Working with raw memory

The `memory` command allows reading or writing raw memory in a debugged program.

Available commands:
`memory read <address>` - reads an 8-byte block at the specified address in the debuggee’s memory
`memory write <address> <value>` - writes an 8-byte value to the specified address.
Note: values are written in little-endian byte order (the last byte of value is stored at the first byte of address).

## Usage example

Consider this Rust program:

```rust
fn print_val(val: u32) {
    println!("val is {val}");
}

fn main() {
    let mut some_val = 3;
    some_val += 1;

    print_val(some_val);
}
```

Goal: Instead of printing 4, we'll manipulate a raw memory to force the output 5.

Let’s do it:

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';
import AsciinemaPlayer from '@site/src/components/AsciinemaPlayer';

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <AsciinemaPlayer src="/BugStalker/casts/memory.cast" />}
</BrowserOnly>
