# Symbol Search

<details>
<summary>What is a debug symbol?</summary>

A debug symbol is a special marker or label programmers add to their 
software programs to help them understand and troubleshoot the code. 
Debug symbols are not human-readable, but programmers use debugging 
tools to interpret them and get meaningful insights.
</details>


The symbol command allows you to search and display debug symbols:
- `symbol <regexp>` - searches for and displays symbols matching the given regular expression pattern

## Usage example

Consider this Rust program:

```rust
fn print_val(val: u32) {
    println!("val is {val}");
}

fn main() {
    let mut some_val = 3;
    some_val += 1;

    print_val(1337);
}
```

Let's examine the symbols:


import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';
import AsciinemaPlayer from '@site/src/components/AsciinemaPlayer';

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <AsciinemaPlayer src="/BugStalker/casts/symbol.cast" />}
</BrowserOnly>
