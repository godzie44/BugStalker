# Watchpoints

Overview of the `watch` command.

## About

A watchpoint is a *data breakpoint*. This means the program stops when the variable (or expression, or raw memory region) 
being observed by the watchpoint is changed. Currently, watchpoints are based on `x86-64` hardware breakpoints, which 
introduces two limitations:

* Only 4 watchpoints can be active at once.
* Watchpoints can only observe memory regions of 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes in size.

## Setting watchpoints

You can set a watchpoint on variables (global or local) or on expressions involving variables. Watchpoints for local 
variables are automatically removed when the variable goes out of scope. If a watchpoint observes a global variable, 
it remains active as long as the debugger is running.

Watchpoints are set with the `watch` (or just `w`) command:

* `watch [+rw][+w] ( <addr>:<size> | <DQE> )` - set write or read-write watchpoint (write by default) for a memory location (size must be one of [1,2,4,8] bytes) or *DQE* with variable
* `watch remove ( <addr>:<size> | <expression> | <number> )` - deactivate and delete the selected watchpoint
* `watch info` - show all watchpoints

Some examples of setting watchpoints:

* `watch my_var` (alias: `w my_var`) - stop when variable value is rewritten
* `watch +rw my_var` - stop when variable value is read or rewritten
* `watch my_vector[0]` - stop when the first vector element is rewritten
* `watch (~my_vector).len` - stop when vector length changes
* `watch 0x100:4` - stop when writing to memory region [0x100:0x103]

## Usage example

Consider this Rust function:

```rust
fn calculate_and_print(mut val: i32) {
    val += 1;
    val += 2;
    val -= 5;
    
    print!("{val}");
}
```

Let's watch the `val` argument:

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';
import AsciinemaPlayer from '@site/src/components/AsciinemaPlayer';

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <AsciinemaPlayer src="/BugStalker/casts/watch.cast" />}
</BrowserOnly>
