# Catch the signal

`BugStalker` catches signals sent from the OS to the debugged program and stops execution.

## Usage example

Consider this Rust code:

```rust
pub fn main() {
    loop {
        std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1));
        println!("tick");
    }
}
```

For example, let's try to send SIGINT (Ctrl+C) to the debugged program:

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';
import AsciinemaPlayer from '@site/src/components/AsciinemaPlayer';

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <AsciinemaPlayer src="/BugStalker/casts/signal.cast" />}
</BrowserOnly>
