# Stepping

Overview of the stepping commands.

## Step commands

Here is a list of available commands for stepping through a stopped program:

- `stepi` - step a single instruction
- `step` (alias: `stepinto`) - step a program until it reaches a different source line
- `next` (alias: `stepover`) - step a program, stepping over subroutine (function) calls
- `finish` (alias: `stepout`) - execute a program until the selected stack frame returns

## Usage example

Consider this Rust code:

```rust
fn print_hello(print_num: u32) {
    for _ in 0..print_num {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let print_num = 3;
    print_hello(print_num);
}
```

And try to do some steps after breaking at the `main` function:

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';
import AsciinemaPlayer from '@site/src/components/AsciinemaPlayer';

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <AsciinemaPlayer src="/BugStalker/casts/step.cast" />}
</BrowserOnly>
