# Async steps

Asynchronous step commands function similarly to regular debugging steps (stepover, stepout), but operate within the context 
of the current task. These commands ensure your program execution stops either:
- at the next step within the current task, or
- when the current task transitions to a completed state

Available commands:
- `async stepover` (alias: `async next`) - Steps through the program while:
    - stepping over function/subroutine calls
    - stopping if the task completes
    - remaining within the current task's context
- `async stepout` (alias: `async finish`) - continues execution until:
    - the current task completes
    - control returns from the current async function

## Usage example

Consider this async Rust program:

```rust
#[tokio::main(worker_threads = 3)]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let t2 = tokio::task::spawn(f2());
    t2.await.unwrap();

    Ok(())
}

async fn f2() {
    let mut vector: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
    let _a = 123;
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200)).await;
    let _b = inner_1(&mut vector, 2).await;

    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200)).await;
    let _c = inner_1(&mut vector, 2).await;
}

async fn inner_1(v: &mut Vec<i32>, val: i32) -> i32 {
    v.push(val);
    let b = val;
    return b;
}
```

To demonstrate these commands:
- set a breakpoint at `f2()` function line: `let _a = 123`;
- use async stepout to execute until the task completes
- restart the program
- use async stepover to step through the task while remaining in its context
