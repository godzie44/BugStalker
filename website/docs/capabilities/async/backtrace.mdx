# Async backtrace

When debugging an asynchronous application, you often need to inspect and control its state. 
In a regular synchronous application, you could simply use the backtrace command. 
However, this command provides limited utility for applications running on an asynchronous runtime.

To address this, BugStalker introduces a suite of "asynchronous backtrace" commands. 
These commands give you visibility into your asynchronous runtime's state, including:
- the status of asynchronous workers and blocking threads
- Detailed information about each task in the system
- each task's current state and its own backtrace - represented as a stack of futures from the root

Available commands:
- `async backtrace` (alias: `async bt`) - Displays information about Tokio async workers and blocking threads, including:
  - worker/blocking thread IDs
  - worker local task queue information
  - currently executing tasks for each worker

- `async backtrace all` (alias: `async bt all`) - similar to the above, but includes information about all tasks in the system. 
Each task is represented with:
  - a unique ID
  - a futures stack showing the chain of dependencies (where one future awaits another)

- `async task <regex>` - prints all tasks with root async functions whose names match the given regular expression. 
If no regex is provided, displays active tasks

## Usage example

Consider this Rust program implementing a TCP echo server using `tokio`:

```rust
#[tokio::main(worker_threads = 3)]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let addr = env::args()
        .nth(1)
        .unwrap_or_else(|| "127.0.0.1:8080".to_string());

    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&addr).await?;
    println!("Listening on: {}", addr);

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = vec![0; 1024];

            loop {
                let n = socket
                    .read(&mut buf)
                    .await
                    .expect("failed to read data from socket");
                if n == 0 {
                    return;
                }

                let (tx, rx) = tokio::sync::oneshot::channel();
                tokio::spawn(async move {
                    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(20)).await;
                    tx.send(1).unwrap();
                });

                tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
                _ = rx.await;

                socket
                    .write_all(&buf[0..n])
                    .await
                    .expect("failed to write data to socket");
            }
        });
    }
}
```

To examine the state of asynchronous execution, lets set a breakpoint at the line `tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;`:

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';
import AsciinemaPlayer from '@site/src/components/AsciinemaPlayer';

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <AsciinemaPlayer src="/BugStalker/casts/async_bt.cast" />}
</BrowserOnly>
