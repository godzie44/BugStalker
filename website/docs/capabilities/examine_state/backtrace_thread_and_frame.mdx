# Examining stack and threads

Overview of the `backtrace`, `thread` and `frame` commands.

## Examining the execution state using `backtrace`, `thread` and `frame` commands

When your program stops, the first thing you need to know is where it stopped and how it got there. These commands can help you investigate:

- `frame info` - displays information about the currently selected frame
- `thread info` - lists information about all threads
- `thread current` - shows the currently selected thread
- `backtrace` (bt) - shows the backtrace of the current thread, including:
    - Thread number and PID
    - Instruction address where execution stopped
    - All frames from the current execution frame (frame 0) up through the call stack
- `backtrace all` (bt all) - shows backtraces for all active threads

## Change current frame and thread

<details>
<summary>What is stack frame?</summary>

The call stack is divided into contiguous pieces called stack frames. Each frame contains the data associated with one function call, including:
* the function's arguments
* its local variables
* the return address

All stack frames are allocated in a memory region called the call stack.
</details>

When a program stops, the frame and thread where execution halted become the current frame and current thread. 
Most of commands operate on these current elements. 
For example, `var locals` prints all local variables in the current frame. If you switch to a different frame, 
`var locals` will display the variables from that function's context.

You can change the current thread or frame by specifying its number (check it using `frame info` or `thread info` commands):
- `frame switch <number>` - changes the current frame
- `thread switch <number>` - changes the current thread

## Usage example

Consider this Rust code:

```rust
pub fn main() {
    for i in 1..3 {
        std::thread::spawn(move || {
            infinite_inc(i);
        });
    }
    
    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(10));
}

fn infinite_inc(step: u32) {
     let mut cntr = 0;
     loop {
        cntr += step;
     }
}
```

Lets try to stop this program, view current frame and thread, inspect the backtrace, change current thread and frame and observe local variables.
