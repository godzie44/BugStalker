# Examining source files

BugStalker can display parts of your program's source code. When your program stops at a breakpoint, 
the debugger automatically shows the current line where execution paused.
Use the `source` command to display additional code.

## The `source` command

- `source fn` - shows the currently selected function
- `source <num>` - displays a range of lines: [current_line-num; current_line+num]
- `source asm` - shows the assembly representation of the current function

## Usage example

Consider this Rust program:

```rust
fn print_hello(print_num: u32) {
    for _ in 0..print_num {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let print_num = 3;
    print_hello(print_num);
}
```

Let's examine the source code by viewing a function, the full file source, and the assembly representation:

import BrowserOnly from '@docusaurus/BrowserOnly';
import AsciinemaPlayer from '@site/src/components/AsciinemaPlayer';

<BrowserOnly>
  {() => <AsciinemaPlayer src="/BugStalker/casts/source.cast" />}
</BrowserOnly>
